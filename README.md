# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life is a cellular automation created by John Conway. It simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on four rules:

1. Any live cell with less than two neighbors dies (as if by solitude).
2. Any live cell with two or three neighbors moves on.
3. Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies (as if by overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with three neighbors becomes a live cell (as if by reproduction).
